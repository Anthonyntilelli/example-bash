## Description                <a name= "Description"></a>

  Bash wrapper for backing up Linux machine with bash version 4.0+. This program will run user provided backup configuration when         called. It uses 2 global constants `GL_BACKUP_CONFIG` and `GL_PRMG_CONFIG` to choose the configuration files. They are set to the         example file for demonstration purposes.  
  
  _Please note_, this script was written for bash learning and experimentation. There are likely better and simpler solutions available. 


  
## Parameters:               <a name="Parameters"></a>

## Configuration files:      <a name="Configuration_files"></a>
 - Files must be ASCII text, owned by script user or root and only writable by owner
 - Lines starting with '#' are comments
 - Backup and program entries are stored in separate files
 - `GL_BACKUP_CONFIG` determines backup file
 - `GL_PRMG_CONFIG` determines the program file
 -  entries are separated by a new line
 -  Fields in an entry are delimited by a ':'
 -  Fields are case sensitive
 -  Any entry with a default can be omitted.

#### backup entry
`<BID>:<Action>:<Program>:<Arguments>:<Source>:<Backup>:<cd>:<UMASK>`

#### backup fields (examples in `example_config/backup.config`)
 - BID - Name of Backup used to identify, when script is called
 - Action - Name of supported backup action (INITIAL,ONGOING,SHOW,RESTORE).
   Add multiple actions together separated by `,`
